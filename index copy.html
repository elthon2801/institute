All these courses are two-year courses and registered under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). After a year, the institute applied for Government Authority from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to elevate the associate degrees to bachelor’s degree; and by virtue of Government Authority in accordance with the pertinent provisions of “Higher Education Act of 1994,” the City College of Angeles was authorized to operate Bachelor Degree courses effective in the Academic Year 2013-2014 for the following programs: BS in Computer Science, BS in Information Systems and BS in Tourism Management.
